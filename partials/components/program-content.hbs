            <p class="gh-program-subtitle">
                Chronic diseases—heart disease, diabetes, obesity—drive 75% of the $4.5 trillion annual healthcare spend, 
                fueling a national debt soaring past $33 trillion, with Medicare and Medicaid eating over 20% of federal budgets.
                The <a href="/a-new-war-for-independence-reclaiming-americas-health" target="_blank">US Health Crisis</a> must be addressed one citizen at a time, targeting the everyday American.
                There are thousands of hours of education and workout programs available, but this can leave the average American overwhelmed and confused.
                Americans need practical, actionable, and sustainable solutions to improve their health.

            <h2 class="gh-program-title">The Commit 250 Program</h2>
            <p class="gh-program-subtitle">The Commit 250 Program is a comprehensive health program 
                meticulously crafted to guide users to build discipline and structure for lasting personal transformation. Uniquely inspired by our nation's 250th anniversary, we focus on US citizens and their practical needs to improve their health.
                First, it's important to understand that the program is <b>not a diet or a workout plan</b>. It's a resource providing you several workout programs, diet programs, and educational resources to improve your health.
                There is so much more to health than diet and exercise. Commit 250 will help you achieve your goals by providing discipline, community, education, and accountability.

                    <p class="gh-section-description">Hence the name: "Commit 250". Before you shy away from the idea of 250 days, don’t worry—there are breaks! The program includes seven training evolutions, each preceded by a preparation week for rest, recovery, and planning. It’s about building lasting change, not chasing quick fixes. We don’t assign specific workouts but offer suggested programs for each evolution, so you won’t have a trainer yelling at you for one more rep. It includes 3-day grace periods to accommodate missed days and busy schedules. The key is to stay consistent. If 250 days feels overwhelming, that’s okay—do what you can. We chose 250 days to align with the theme of our nation’s 250th anniversary. If it seems like too much, remember, there are plenty of breaks along the way. Think about how far you could go in 250 days. What are you willing to do to improve your health, inspire others, and help combat this health crisis? Fight for your health. Sign up today.</p>

                    <p class="gh-section-description">This is where WE ARE DIFFERENT. We challenge users to be intentional about gratitude. Through a Daily Gratitude exercise the user starts their day grounding themselves in appreciation for the abundance they have in their life. We focus on those that have given so much to make this great nation. There are repeated scientific studies showing the mental health benefits to practicing gratitude. You will read incredible historical accounts across America's most pivotal moments. Maybe you'll even learn a little history, but you will certainly gain an appreciation for the resilience and grit of those that have come before us.</p>

                    <p class="gh-section-description">Where planning lacks, convenience reigns. Americans are slaves to convenience because we do not plan. When we make choices out of convenience, often we are not making healthy choices. Commit 250 has the user take actionable steps across the week to plan and prepare for the upcoming training evolution. This allows users to account for meal planning, kids' schedules, work, and other commitments.</p>

                    <p class="gh-section-description">This unique approach allows users to realistically achieve 250 days of training. Each prep week coincides with rest and recovery, allowing users to learn the larger benefits of what is coming in the next training cycle. As an example, in one evolution users will schedule blood work if they do not have a recent test. They then proceed through the training evolution reading about each marker, its range, effects, and ultimately what mitigations can be taken to improve that marker. Another evolution the same structured approach is taken with studying hormone health. During the 4 weeks of training, users have daily checklists to work through regarding exercise, nutrition, gratitude, and more. These checklists grow as users get more accustomed to the program.</p>

                    <p class="gh-section-description">The program is firmly grounded in the principles of habit formation, as outlined by Charles Duhigg in his seminal work, The Power of Habit (Duhigg, 2012), and draws heavily on the behavioral psychology insights provided by Atomic Habits (Clear, 2018). Using these and modern micro-learning practices, we build lasting change through lasting habits.</p>

We challenge users to keep the schedule and avoid missing a day to keep users on track. The goal is to build the discipline necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

During your training weeks you will take part in 30 minutes minimum of arduous exercise daily with a reminder to stay on your chosen diet. Whether it's intermittent fasting, keto, paleo, or something else, you will be encouraged to find a program that works for you. Each day starts with a Daily Gratitude to pay respects to the great Americans before us and maintain perspective on this journey.

How many folks don't let their voice be heard because of a lack of confidence? How many folks did not speak up when it was needed because they were not in a healthy place? Coupled with your standard daily diet, physical and mental exercise, we add the challenge to learn your local civics. Contact your mayor's office, your local community representatives. If you have held something back you wish to speak on, now is the time. During your training weeks we encourage you to reach out to friends and family. Folks that you may have lost touch with over time. Pick up the phone and make the call. Life is too short.</p>
