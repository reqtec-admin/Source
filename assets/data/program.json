            "description": "Before you run away at the prospect of 250 days of intense workouts, understand this program incorporates 7 training evolutions with 1 preparation week before each used for rest, recovery, and planning. The program is about building lasting change, not about quick fixes. We do not assign specific workouts but have suggested programs for each evolution so you don't have to worry about a trainer yelling at you for one more rep. It includes 3 day grace periods to allow for missed days and busy schedules. The key is to just keep after it. We chose 250 days because it aligns with the theme of our nation's 250th anniversary. If 250 days seems like too much, remember, many of us are willing to die for our family or nation, but are you willing to work hard for them? What are you willing to do to get your health in order, to inspire others, and to do your part to combat this health crisis? Sign up and we will give you a way to do something.",

Through a Daily Gratitude exercise the user starts their day grounding themselves in appreciation for the abundance they have in their life. We focus on those that have given so much to make this great nation. There are repeated scientific studies showing the mental health benefits to practicing gratitude. You will read incredible historical accounts across America's most pivotal moments. Maybe you'll even learn a little history, but you will certainly gain an appreciation for the resilience and grit of those that have come before us.",

Each prep week coincides with rest and recovery allowing users to learn the larger benefits of what is coming in the next training cycle. As an example, in one evolution users will schedule blood work if they do not have a recent test. They then proceed through the training evolution reading about each marker, its range, effects and ultimately what mitigations can be taken to improve that marker. Another evolution the same structured approach is taken with studying hormone health. During the 4 weeks of training, users have daily checklists to work through regarding exercise, nutrition, gratitude, and more. These checklists grow as users get more accustomed to the program.",
